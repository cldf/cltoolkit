# Notes:
The allophones of /ɛ/ /u/ and /ɛ̃/ were assigned by Louise.

# Errors:

/õ/ occurs once in the transcript, but is not discussed anywhere in the paper. It immediately follows a nasal consonant, so could be a nasalised allophone of /o/. However, I'm reluctant to enter it as such, because of the contrast in other vowels between oral and nasal. I recommend we leave it as an error.
/ɑ/ The author writes: "Some speakers have a contrast between two low vowels [a] and [ɑ]; our speaker has only one low vowel, [a], which is central." p73 This means the [ɑ] that appears in the multiple instances of the same word in the transcript is either a typo or an allophone of /ɑ̃/. I recommend we leave it as an error, as we don't have enough information to make the call.
/iː/ Not discussed in the paper. There are two orthographic instances of the word that it occurs in "ils". The first consists of four sounds, the second just this long vowel, which makes it appear like an abbreviated form of the word. But reluctant to say that it is an allophone of /i/. I recommend leaving it as an error. 

All of the missing vowels appear in the transcript, but are not discussed in the paper. They could probably be assigned as allophones to phonemes, fi we wanted to do this.
