# Notes:
Some phonetic features present in the transcription are not discussed in the text. 
This includes non-syllablic marking on vowels, and dental marking on consonants. 
They are treated as allophones of their unmarked counterpart. I have treated the labio-dental
nasal as an allophone of the bilabial nasal. 

There are three narrative recordings. The first an exerpt from a longer narrative by a 63 year old woman (not presented here),
and two versions of the North Wind and Sun, as told by a man and a woman. The transcribed version is that from the woman's recording. 
 
 
# Errors:
/ð/ missing diacritic in transcription, probably author’s typo.
/w/ not discussed in paper, but present in transcription.
