# Notes:
Nothing was said about nasalised, rounded, centralised or lengthened vowels in the JIPA paper. For this reason they are added as allophones
to their non-nasalised/unrounded/non-lengthened/non-centralised counterpart.
Nothing was mentioned about syllabic nasals and laterals in the JIPA paper. They have been added in as allophones.
Nothing was mentioned in the JIPA paper about the glottal stop. It is assumed to be non-phonemic.
Nothing was said of creaky voice in the paper. Sounds in the transcript with creaky voice have been added as allophones.
